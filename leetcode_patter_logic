This problem from LeetCode — "1948. Delete Duplicate Folders in System" — uses a combination of Trie (prefix tree) and Post-order 
Traversal with Hashing/Serialization. These are very common design patterns used by LeetCode aspirants and interviewees to solve problems related to hierarchical 
data or trees. Let’s break down the core patterns used:  ????



Final Tip:
These patterns — Trie + DFS + Hashing — form a very reusable approach for many LeetCode problems involving:

File/folder systems

Duplicates in tree-like structures

Path matching

Autocomplete systems
